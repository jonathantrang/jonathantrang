<h1>Greetings 👋</h1>
My name is Jonathan Trang, a full stack software engineer. I have a passion for user-centered design and because of that I continuously curate my code in a way of answering, "How does this benefit the user?"

<h2>😃 About Me!</h2>
<p>After graduating from Cal Poly Pomona I went into the hospitality industry, as a Project Coordinator for the purchasing/contracts department of TriMark. During this time I built my knowledge in the corporate setting by meeting monthly, quarterly, and yearly deadlines, communicating with clients/teammates, and completing projects with multiple teams. Although I enjoyed the knowledge that TriMark had provided to me I realized that I had another calling.</p>

<p>Thus my transition into coding. A path where I can solve problems, challenge myself, and provide a product that users can enjoy. In order to continue on this path however I need to build the necessary skills. That is why I chose to attend a rigorous three month full immersion Web Development program offered by LearningFuze.</p>
